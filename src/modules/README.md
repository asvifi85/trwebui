This README is a placeholder for the component module files. Once a module has been created in this directory, this README can be removed. 

The directory structure should be as follows:

```
|- src/ 
  |- modules/
    |- component-one/ // This is where the stand-alone belongs
      |- component-one-module.js  // *-module.js is required here.
    
```
